            <p>STEM jobs number about 19 million according to Pew Research. STEM jobs also pay close to double the median range. While girls outperform boys in science, on average, there is still an 
                under representaion on women in many STEM Fields. According to Pew Research, women represent about 50% of the STEM workforce overall, but as shown in the chart to the right, this varies 
                significantly from 15% in engineering, to 74% in Healthcare. Note - there is no universal classification of which careers specifically belong in STEM. Some are easy
             to classify like engineers or mathemeticians. However, science and technology are broader definitions, and different people/groups have different interpretations; espcially when in comes to 
             social sciences and healthcare roles. Therefore, not every study can be compared one to one.</p>
